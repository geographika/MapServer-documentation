"Another exciting feature of MapServer is its ability to use layers from "
"other map servers. In this case, a MapServer application becomes a WMS (or "
"WFS) client. MapServer can also share (or serve up) the layers in the "
"mapfile to other map servers. This makes an application a WMS (or WFS) "
"server. What is WMS or WFS? These are \"web-based interoperability service\""
" specifications published by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). WMS "
"stands for Web Map Service and WFS for Web Feature Service. The difference "

"Geography Markup Language. A third OGC interoperability specification is the"
" Web Coverage Services specification or WCS.  MapServer supports WCS at the "
